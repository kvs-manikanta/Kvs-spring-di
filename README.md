Spring Dependency Injection
Spring Dependency Injection is a powerful feature of the Spring Framework that allows for the injection of dependencies into a class, reducing coupling and increasing modularity in your application.


In object-oriented programming, it is common for objects to depend on other objects to perform their tasks. Traditionally, these dependencies were instantiated inside the dependent object. This can lead to tight coupling between objects and make the code difficult to maintain and modify.

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the creation of loosely coupled objects by delegating the responsibility of object creation and wiring to an external framework or container. Spring Dependency Injection is one such framework that allows for the injection of dependencies into a class.

What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that separates the creation and wiring of objects from the objects themselves. This pattern aims to reduce coupling between objects and increase modularity in your application.
